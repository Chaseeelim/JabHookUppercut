Maintain a balanced, stable stance. Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with your non-dominant foot forward (if you're right-handed, your left foot should be forward). This stance provides stability and power.
Use the jab as both an offensive and defensive tool. It can help you gauge distance, set up more powerful punches, and keep your opponent at bay. Keep your jab quick and retract it immediately to guard your face.
Rotate your rear foot and hip as you throw a cross to maximize power. The cross should be a straight punch from your back hand, traveling directly to the target with full body rotation for added force.
When throwing a hook, pivot on your lead foot and rotate your torso to generate power. Keep your elbow bent at about 90 degrees and aim to strike with your lead knuckle
Exhale sharply with each punch. This helps with power and maintaining rhythm. It also keeps you relaxed and prevents you from getting winded too quickly.
Always return your hands to guard position after each punch. This is crucial to protect yourself from counterattacks, especially after a hook which can leave you exposed.
Practice combining these punches effectively. A common combination is the jab-cross-hook, which utilizes different angles and levels to break through your opponent's guard.
Work on hitting a precise spot on the punching bag or in shadowboxing. Accuracy is as important as power, particularly with the jab and cross, which can create openings for more devastating combinations.
Good footwork enhances every punch. Move in and out quickly with your jabs, and use lateral movement to position yourself for crosses and hooks. Never be a stationary target.
Regular practice is key. Use drills to focus separately on speed, power, and technique for your jabs, crosses, and hooks. Incorporate shadowboxing, heavy bag, and pad work into your routine.
